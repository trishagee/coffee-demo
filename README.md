Cafelito - Give Me Coffee!!
========

Web application demoed at conferences.  See history for how it builds up, and check out the branches to see different versions presented at different conferences.

There's an interview describing the motivation behind this project and a video demonstrating how to build up the application in [this blog post](http://trishagee.github.io/presentation/interview_at_goto_chicago/).

The Groovy script that imports data into MongoDB has been dissected in 
[this blog post](http://trishagee.github.io/post/groovy_import_to_mongodb/).

There's a recording of the  
[Virtual User Group Session](http://virtualjug.com/html5-angularjs-groovy-java-and-mongodb-all-together-what-could-go-wrong/), 
where you can see this application being built "live".
